PROJECT  TITLE  :  WINE QUALITY PREDICTION

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics using machine learning classification techniques. The aim is to analyze how features such as acidity, density, alcohol content, and other chemical properties influence wine quality and to compare the performance of different classifier models.

STEPS PERFORMED
1.	Imported the wine quality dataset into the Python environment.
2.	Performed data exploration to understand the structure, attributes, and statistical properties of the dataset.
3.	Checked for missing values and ensured data cleanliness.
4.	Visualized data patterns and correlations using plots and heatmaps.
5.	Selected input features and target variable for model training.
6.	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
7.	Applied feature scaling to normalize the data.
8.	Trained three classifier models: Random Forest, SGD Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
9.	Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.
10.	Compared the results of all models to identify the best-performing classifier.


TOOLS USED
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries:
o	Pandas – data manipulation
o	NumPy – numerical computations
o	Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
o	Scikit-learn – machine learning models and evaluation
•	Platform: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook


THE OUTCOME IN BRIEF
The project successfully predicted wine quality using machine learning classification models. Among the three models implemented, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in handling complex feature interactions. Data visualization revealed strong relationships between certain chemical attributes and wine quality, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in the field of viticulture.
